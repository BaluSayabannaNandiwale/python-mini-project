# Hostapd Password Hashing

## Description

This project provides a Python script to hash passwords using the Hostapd algorithm (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256). It includes a function to hash a password with a given salt and a specified number of iterations.

## Features

- **Password Hashing**: Uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 to securely hash passwords.
- **Customizable Iterations**: Allows specifying the number of iterations for the hashing algorithm.
- **Hexadecimal Output**: Returns the hashed password as a hexadecimal string.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hostapd-password-hash.git
    cd hostapd-password-hash
    ```

2. No additional packages are required as the script uses standard Python libraries.

## Usage

1. Open the `password_hash.py` file.
2. Modify the `password` and `salt` variables as needed.
3. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python password_hash.py
    ```

4. The script will output the hashed password.

## Code Explanation

- **hostapd_password_hash Function**: This function hashes a password using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a specified salt and number of iterations.
- **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how to use the function to hash a password and print the result.

### Notes

- Ensure to use a random and secure salt value for each password.
- Adjust the number of iterations based on your security requirements.
